# Annual Birth Data Pie Chart by Months and Quarters
This is a nested pie chart displaying annual birth data between the years 1967 and 2014, both by months and quarters, built with `D3.JS` and `SVGs`

The `input slider` can be used to adjust the `annual year` to display birth data for

The `outer chart` displays the `months` from `January to December` counter-clockwise, while the `inner chart` displays the `annual quarters` from `1 to 4` counter-clockwise

The data used has been sourced and compiled from [UN data](https://data.un.org/)

The app, and online editor, can also be found here on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/d3-annual-birth-data-nested-pie-chart-using-svg-63xpe)
